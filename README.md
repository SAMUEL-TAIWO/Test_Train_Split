# Train-Test Split 🚂🔀🚋

## Overview
Train-Test Split is a crucial step in machine learning to evaluate model performance. It partitions the dataset into training and testing sets, facilitating model validation.

## How it Works
The method divides the dataset into two subsets: one for training the model and the other for testing its performance. A common split ratio is 80% for training and 20% for testing.


## Benefits
- Allows assessing model generalization. 
- Mitigates overfitting by evaluating performance on unseen data. 
- Essential for effective model validation.


## Note
Consider the appropriate split ratio based on your dataset size and complexity. Adjust parameters like 'test_size' accordingly.

## Features
- Easy integration with scikit-learn and other machine learning frameworks.
- Customizable split ratios and randomization.
- Consistent methodology for model evaluation.
